## Exploring the data
The goal is to see if there is a pattern that can be explored with greater validity in a larger and more robust data set.

### Notes on raw data
- Only 34 rows of data (not a very big sample)
- Spans approx. one-month period (as above)
- All data (except Volume) appears to be in the 32 - 360 range
- Range data will be interesting to explore 
  - It's unclear looking at the raw data if there's a trend
  - Unclear if Open or Close tend to be higher
  - Maybe try correlating each with High and Low?
  - Again, look at ranges
- There are some days that appear closer to a high (e.g. 02/16/2024)
- Most days seem to fall into a relatively tight range (4 - 6 points)

- Overall, this suggests a certain degree of correlation amongst the scores
- Things to explore will be direction of price change
- Relationships between Open and Close
- Change relative to volume
- How prices move together
